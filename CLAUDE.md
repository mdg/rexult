# Project - Rexult

Rexult is an Elixir library meant to replicate the interface of the
std::result::Result library from the Rust programming language. It will also
have some extensions specific to this library and Elixir.

The Rust documentation for the Result type is at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html
